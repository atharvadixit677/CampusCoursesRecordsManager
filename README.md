## Java Editions: ME vs SE vs EE

| Edition      | Description                        | Use Case                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|

## Java Architecture: JDK, JRE, JVM

- **JDK (Java Development Kit):**  
  Full development kit including compiler (javac), libraries, and tools.

- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**  
  Includes JVM and core libraries to run Java applications but no development tools.

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**  
  Executes Java bytecode on a given platform providing portability.

### Interaction:  
Developers write code → JDK compiles code → JVM runs compiled bytecode with JRE supporting runtime.

## Installing and Configuring Java on Windows

1. Download the latest Java JDK from [Oracle/OpenJDK site].
2. Run the installer and follow instructions.
3. Set environment variables:
   - Add `JAVA_HOME` pointing to JDK installation directory.
   - Append `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the `Path` variable.

## Using Eclipse IDE: New Project Creation and Run Configurations

1. Open Eclipse IDE.
2. File → New → Java Project.
3. Enter project name, uncheck “Use default location” to select desired workspace.
4. Choose “Create separate folders for sources and class files”.
5. Click Finish.

### Running the project

- Right-click the main class → Run As → Java Application.
